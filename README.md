TunnelMan video game created in C++.

THe player has to dig through the dirts to collect a certain number of oil barrels pre round, while avoiding protesters, in order to complete each level. To interrupt player's mission, there will be protesters who will follow user and shout at him until user's health points drop zero (in which case player loses a life).

Along his journey, the tunnelman can use items (golds, water guns, and sonar kits) to deeter protesters and help uncover oil barrel locations.

Players can drop golds by pressing 'Tab' to bribe protesters to either leave the game or to be stunned for temporary time (it depends what type of protester it is).

If protesters get nearby, player can also shoot water guns to stun protesters, by pressing 'space', in which case, they will, if shot sufficiently, die and return to start location.

Lastly, players can also use sonar kits by pressing key 'z', which will reveal hidden items buried deep within dirts.

Each level progressively increments and becomes more and more difficult, with more protestors and more oil to be found.
